# Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning Competition
In this repository you can find the *Jupyter Notebooks* and *reports* used in the 2023/2024 competition of the *Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning* course held in Politecnico di Milano A.Y. 2023/24 by professors Matteo Matteucci and Giacomo Boracchi.

The competition was based on two different challenges:
- Image Classification
- Time Series Forecasting

* [Andrea Gerosa](https://github.com/Jerry98x)
* [Giulio Saulle](https://github.com/GiulioSaulle)


## 1. Image Classification
**Goal:** build a binary classifier to correclty classify images of plants that were divided into two categories according to their state of health (1 = healthy, 0 = unhealthy).

**Dataset Details**: 
- Image size: 96x96
- Color space: RGB
- File Format: NPZ

**Evaluation metric**: Hidden test set accuracy

### Scores   

- Accuracy: 87.7%

- Placing: 40/581

- Points gained: 5/5

## 2. Time Series Forecasting
**Goal:** having 48000 univariate time series, divided into 6 different categories and each one with different length, the objective was to build forcasting models able to properly generalize the training dataset and correctly predict the next 18 samples.
